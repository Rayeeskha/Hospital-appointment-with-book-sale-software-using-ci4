Family counselling is flexible because every family is unique. The goal is to help families build stronger relationships, but this will mean different things to different families, as we all have unique challenges. Ultimately, the aim is for families to enjoy being together and to face life’s challenges as a team. A family counsellor maintains neutrality at all times, to establish a platform free from blame. This allows members to explore the problem and then express their concerns for the family’s ability to change.',

Family members are then invited to be observers, too, of the questions answered by other members and of their own behaviours and assumptions. The trained family counsellor offers the group an opportunity to think and reflect on the present situation with a view to moving towards a better way of being together. An assessment can be difficult due to the different natures of family dynamics - defining where the problem is can mean something different to each member of the family. One person might be blamed and they, in turn, may blame someone else. If this issue gets stuck, these two members might work together for a couple of sessions. The interconnected set of relationships within the family is central to this type of counselling. The logistics of getting all members along to participate in counselling can pose difficulties, but it can be a satisfying and rewarding means to establish new and healthier way of relating. Not all members have to attend every session; couples counselling, youth work or individual counselling may follow and the family may meet later to discuss changes.',

There are many options out there, and with a little bit of research you should be able to find the right fit.

The most comprehensive review of token procedures to match childrens level of behavioral severity was Walkers text "The Acting Out Child."',
